summary: "ClickHouse OSS is easy to start and fast on one node. The hidden cost appears when growth turns one node into shards, replicas, Keeper, and a distributed system your team must operate."

ClickHouse OSS is remarkably easy to start. Put it on a large machine, point data at it, and it will take you surprisingly far.

The difficult part begins when one machine is no longer enough.

I have spent a lot of time operating self-managed ClickHouse clusters, and the costs that matter most rarely appear in the first infrastructure estimate. They emerge later: when a shard fills up, when another replica is needed, when replication falls behind, when Keeper becomes the coordination hot spot, or when a topology change turns into a migration project.

These are not bugs in ClickHouse. They are consequences of its shared-nothing architecture.

## The shared-nothing bargain

In a typical self-managed ClickHouse cluster, each node owns local data and local compute. To store more data or use more CPU, you divide the dataset into **shards**. To survive failures or add read capacity, you create **replicas** of those shards.

The model is simple:

- Shards split the data.
- Replicas copy the data.
- `Distributed` tables route work across shards.
- `ReplicatedMergeTree` and ClickHouse Keeper coordinate replicas.

This design performs well because computation happens close to local data. It also means that storage layout, compute capacity, and cluster topology are coupled. Adding a server is not the same as adding usable capacity.

That coupling is where the hidden cost starts.

## Sharding makes scaling a data-placement problem

Suppose a cluster begins with one shard and two replicas. When the shard approaches its storage or compute limit, adding another shard does not automatically redistribute existing data.

You now have to make several decisions:

- What is the new sharding key?
- Does historical data need to move?
- How will writes transition to the new topology?
- Can queries tolerate data living under two layouts during the migration?
- How do you validate that nothing was duplicated or missed?

Even when old data stays where it is and only new writes use the new shard, the cluster becomes less balanced over time. If data must be redistributed, scaling becomes an I/O-heavy migration with operational risk.

Query behavior changes too. A distributed query fans out to the relevant shards and waits for their results. One overloaded or unhealthy shard can determine tail latency for the entire query. The more shards a query touches, the more network calls and failure surfaces it acquires.

The hardware is only the visible cost. The hidden cost is designing, executing, observing, and sometimes rolling back the topology change.

## Replicas multiply more than storage

Replicas are necessary for high availability and can increase read throughput, but a replica is not free compute attached to existing storage. It is another full copy of the shard.

Adding a replica means:

- Copying or fetching all of the shard's data.
- Paying for another full set of disks.
- Running background merges on another server.
- Warming another local cache.
- Routing traffic so the extra read capacity is actually used.
- Monitoring replication queues and lag.
- Planning for the network and I/O load of recovery after a failure.

A cluster with two shards and two replicas already has four data-bearing nodes. Moving to four shards with two replicas doubles that footprint to eight. If storage and compute requirements grow at different rates, the topology cannot express that cleanly: scaling one often means paying for more of the other.

Replication also changes failure recovery. A replacement node may be easy to provision, but it is not useful until it has recovered enough data and cache state to serve the workload safely. At large data volumes, that recovery path deserves the same capacity planning as normal traffic.

## Keeper becomes part of the scaling boundary

`ReplicatedMergeTree` uses ClickHouse Keeper to coordinate replication metadata. Keeper does not store the table data itself, but it sits on the control path for replicated tables, parts, mutations, and other coordination work.

Once replication is introduced, the ClickHouse cluster is no longer the only system the team operates. Keeper needs its own odd-sized quorum, durable storage, backups, monitoring, upgrades, latency budgets, and failure procedures.

As the number of replicated tables, parts, replicas, and metadata operations grows, Keeper receives more coordination traffic. A workload that creates many small parts or performs frequent schema and mutation operations can make that pressure visible quickly. Scaling the ClickHouse data nodes does not automatically scale away a Keeper bottleneck.

In practice, this creates another class of incidents to understand:

- Is replication slow because a replica is overloaded?
- Is the network dropping coordination requests?
- Is Keeper latency increasing?
- Are there too many parts or queued operations?
- Will restarting a node reduce pressure or trigger an expensive recovery?

Keeper is a solid coordination system. The hidden cost is that coordination itself becomes production infrastructure owned by your team.

## The operational bill is larger than the server bill

The raw infrastructure comparison between ClickHouse OSS and ClickHouse Cloud is tempting: add up instances and disks, compare the number with the managed-service price, and declare self-hosting cheaper.

That comparison leaves out the work required to keep a shared-nothing cluster healthy:

- Capacity planning for each shard.
- Rebalancing and resharding.
- Replica placement across failure domains.
- Keeper operation and recovery.
- Backups and restore testing.
- Rolling upgrades across compatible versions.
- Configuration consistency across nodes.
- Monitoring merges, parts, queues, disks, and query fan-out.
- On-call time when any of these systems interact badly.

For a large, steady workload with an experienced platform team, self-managed ClickHouse can still be the right economic choice. But the honest cost is not just compute plus storage. It includes the engineering time and operational risk created by the topology.

## What shared storage changes

ClickHouse Cloud uses `SharedMergeTree`: table data lives in shared object storage, while compute replicas process that data. The durable copy of the dataset is no longer tied to the lifecycle of an individual compute node. ClickHouse describes this as the progression from shared-nothing servers with local state to [stateless compute over shared data](https://clickhouse.com/blog/clickhouse-cloud-stateless-compute).

That changes the scaling problem:

- Adding compute does not require creating another full durable copy of the data.
- Replacing a compute node does not require rebuilding the dataset from another replica.
- Storage and compute can grow more independently.
- Multiple compute services can use the same underlying data.
- Horizontal scaling does not require manually resharding the table first.

This does not make distributed systems disappear. New compute still needs CPU, memory, local cache warm-up, and coordination. Object storage introduces its own latency and cost model. ClickHouse Cloud also charges a managed-service premium and gives the operator less control over versions, configuration, and infrastructure.

But it removes a particularly expensive coupling: in the shared-nothing model, scaling compute, moving data, and changing topology are often the same operation. With shared storage, they can be separate operations.

## The real trade-off

The difference between ClickHouse OSS and ClickHouse Cloud is not simply free software versus a cloud bill.

It is a choice about where complexity lives.

With self-managed ClickHouse, the software is open and the infrastructure can be cheaper, but the user owns sharding, replication, coordination, recovery, and the people-hours behind them. With ClickHouse Cloud, more of that complexity is absorbed by the platform, and the premium appears directly on the invoice.

After operating the OSS architecture, the question I keep coming back to is not whether shared storage is useful. It clearly is.

The more interesting question is whether we can get its decoupled scaling model without giving up the control and economics that make open-source ClickHouse attractive.

That is the architecture I want to explore next.
